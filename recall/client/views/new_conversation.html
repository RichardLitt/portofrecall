Welcome to Port of Recall.

This is a simple app, and it's meant to be used simply. The idea is that we've got too much on our minds; but your next meeting with an investor, colleague, or friends might change your life. 

By providing an easy way to store notes after conversations, we help you offload what you gleaned from an experience, and help you store it in a centralised database meant only for remembering. Not pictures, not LinkedIn integrations, no friends. Just you, and this journal.
